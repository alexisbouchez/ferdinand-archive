description: Self-host Ferdinand to have full control over your email sending.

<Warning>
    Ferdinand is still early, and the self-hosting process should be considered **experimental**. 
    We are working on improving the self-hosting experience, and we welcome your **feedback**.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you start self-hosting Ferdinand, you need to have the following prerequisites:
- A server running Debian 10 or later
- A domain name, with A, AAAA and MX records on `mail.<domain>.<tld>` pointing to your server
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [The Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [The Templ CLI](https://templ.guide/quick-start/installation)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Ferdinand repository on your server:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/valyentdev/ferdinand.git
```

2. **Change directory to the cloned repository:**

```sh
cd ferdinand
```

3. **Run the `templ` command to generate the views:**

```sh
templ generate
```

4. **Create a `.env` file, by copying the `.env.example` file:**

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

5. **Edit the `.env` file to set the missing environment variables:**

```sh
vim .env
```

6. **Copy the `.env` file to `/var/ferdinand.env`**

```sh
sudo cp .env /var/ferdinand.env
```

7. **Run the SMTP service:**

Make sure that the 465, 80, and 443 ports are open on your server.

Build the SMTP service binary, and move it to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:
```sh
go build -o /usr/local/bin/smtp ./cmd/smtp
```

Create a systemd service file for the SMTP service:
```sh
sudo cp ./zarf/smtp.service /etc/systemd/system/smtp.service
```

Start the SMTP service:
```sh
sudo systemctl start smtp
```

8. **Edit the Caddyfile, to set your domain name:**

```sh
vim zarf/Caddyfile
```

9. **Run the `docker compose` command to start the web-related services:**

```sh
docker compose -f ./zarf/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

10. **Access the dashboard at `https://mail.<domain>.<tld>`**

11. **Optional: Create an API key in the dashboard, and use it to send forgot password emails.**

Don't forget to modify the .env file to set the correct values for the environment variables, and to restart the Docker services after making changes to the .env file.
